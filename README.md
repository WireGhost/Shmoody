SOC Humor: How to use Memes and Chaos to improve detection. 

WireghosX 1st tak submission and talk for ShmooCon XX (2025) Friday January 10th, 2025 

This is not a technical talk, which is more or my area of research, but explores unconvention ways to incorporate Humor and Memes in order to strengthen detection. Improve an alert fatigued SOC, potentially with low more, while promoting knowledge sharing, engagement, response, and inclusion. 


At this time this should be public, and I will add more memes used from the pesentation.
