Since 2013, finally decided to actually submit a talk ;)
1st talk submission/cfp and talk for ShmooCon XX (2025) Friday January 10th, 2025 

This is not a technical talk, which is more or my area of research, but explores unconvention ways to incorporate humor and memes in order to enhabce detection. Tactics to impove an alert fatigued SOC, potentially with low moral, while promoting knowledge sharing, engagement, response, and inclusion.
